\section{Topic}
Currently, there are very few, if any, models capable of efficiently computing photorealistic animatable hand avatars such that it could be generated in real time. This would have various applications such as egocentric tutorials, realistic rendering of user’s hands in VR environments, and many more.

Our research seeks to take the paper, Reduced Gaussian Blendshapes Avatar (RGBAvatar) which creates photorealistic animatable head avatars using Gaussian splatting, and apply it to hands instead. The RGBAvatar dataset depends on Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions (FLAME) which is a model that constructs a set of blendshapes that can be efficiently combined to represent a vast array of face expressions.

Rather than using FLAME for our model, we can instead implement the hand Model with Articulated and Non-rigid defOrmations (MANO) model. This model is nearly identical to FLAME in that it combines a set of blendshapes to form a mesh, however the meshes that it creates are of hands rather than faces. This is vital for application because it allows the models to be relatively interchangeable while completely altering the output image.

% FLAME Parameters <- INSTA <- Metrical Tracker <- MICA
% MANO Parameters <- Extract_MANO(HaMeR)

RGBAvatar relies on a series of papers in order to estimate its FLAME parameters. MetrIC fAce (MICA) estimates the 3D FLAME parameters for the head geometry in a neutral expression from a single 2D image of a person in any pose with any facial expression. From there, the Metrical Tracker is able to estimate the facial motion in metrical space, thereby refining and optimizing the FLAME parameters while also executing facial expression tracking. Finally, after that, the Instant Volumetric Head Avatars (INSTA) model adds accurate volume and texture to the generated head meshes which returns a photorealistic head avatar. However, INSTA is flawed because it takes ~10 minutes to generate the avatar. By extracting the FLAME parameters from INSTA, RGBAvatar is able to create a similar photorealistic head avatar in real time.

In an application of RGBAvatar onto hands, we will instead use MANO parameters. First, Hand Mesh Recovery (HaMeR) generates an accurate 3D mesh for hands using Vision Transformers when given an RGB image. This mesh has no texture or skin, so we will extract its MANO parameters and pass those into the RGBAvatar model to achieve photorealistic hand avatars.

\section{Datasets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://facebookresearch.github.io/hot3d/}{Meta HOT3D}
\end{itemize}


The dataset we are planning to use is the “HOT3D” data set by Meta. This is an egocentric dataset for 3D hand and object tracking. HOT3D is a benchmark dataset designed for evaluating egocentric 3D tracking of hands and objects. It contains 833 minutes of multi-view video data featuring 19 participants interacting with 33 different rigid objects. Each frame is precisely annotated with the 3D poses and shapes of both the hands and objects.

\section{Each Contributions}

We have three major parts to our progress that we are aiming to complete: reproduction, cross-application, and real time processing.
For reproduction, we have four main steps which form our data pipeline which we outlined above. Miachel will be primarily responsible 
for reporducing the original RGBAvatar's final output by chaining together smaller functions.

The next step, cross-application, has two approaches. The first of which, which Wyatt will be responsible for, is recreating the 
results of RGBAvatar with the predefined Meta Hot3d dataset. On the other hand, Jae will be using Hamer to extract MANO values and 
recreating the results of RGBAvatar from there.

Finally, time permitting, we aim to create a real-time processor for hand avatars following the RGBAvatar model.

\section{Early Experiments}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{images/headImage.jpeg}
  \caption{Initial Result of the RGBAvatar Code Reproduce}
  \label{fig:Reproduce}
\end{figure}

During the initial reproduction of the RGBAvatar codebase, we observed that the quality of facial segmentation plays a critical role in the final rendering results.
In particular, we noticed visible artifacts, such as rainbow-colored edges, around the avatar's face. We believe these reasons are inaccurate or imprecise segmentation.
To achieve the significantly cleaner results produced by the INSTA pipeline segmentation method, we intend to adopt INSTA's segmentation approach in our implementation. 
This will ensure more accurate and visually consistent reconstructions.

% \end{table*}

% Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
% We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
% You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
% You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
% You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

% A possessive citation can be made with the command \verb|\citeposs|.
% This is not a standard natbib command, so it is generally not compatible
% with other style files.

% \subsection{References}

% \nocite{Ando2005,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015}

% The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly follow the American Psychological Association format.
% If your own bib file is named \texttt{custom.bib}, then placing the following before any appendices in your \LaTeX{} file will generate the references section for you:
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \bibliography{custom}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{quote}

% You can obtain the complete ACL Anthology as a Bib\TeX{} file from \url{https://aclweb.org/anthology/anthology.bib.gz}.
% To include both the Anthology and your own .bib file, use the following instead of the above.
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \bibliography{anthology,custom}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{quote}

% Please see Section~\ref{sec:bibtex} for information on preparing Bib\TeX{} files.

% \subsection{Equations}

% An example equation is shown below:
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:example}
%   A = \pi r^2
% \end{equation}

% Labels for equation numbers, sections, subsections, figures and tables
% are all defined with the \verb|\label{label}| command and cross references
% to them are made with the \verb|\ref{label}| command.

% This an example cross-reference to Equation~\ref{eq:example}.

% \subsection{Appendices}

% Use \verb|\appendix| before any appendix section to switch the section numbering over to letters. See Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix} for an example.

% \section{Bib\TeX{} Files}
% \label{sec:bibtex}

% Unicode cannot be used in Bib\TeX{} entries, and some ways of typing special characters can disrupt Bib\TeX's alphabetization. The recommended way of typing special characters is shown in Table~\ref{tab:accents}.

% Please ensure that Bib\TeX{} records contain DOIs or URLs when possible, and for all the ACL materials that you reference.
% Use the \verb|doi| field for DOIs and the \verb|url| field for URLs.
% If a Bib\TeX{} entry has a URL or DOI field, the paper title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink to the paper, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.

% \section*{Limitations}

% Since December 2023, a "Limitations" section has been required for all papers submitted to ACL Rolling Review (ARR). This section should be placed at the end of the paper, before the references. The "Limitations" section (along with, optionally, a section for ethical considerations) may be up to one page and will not count toward the final page limit. Note that these files may be used by venues that do not rely on ARR so it is recommended to verify the requirement of a "Limitations" section and other criteria with the venue in question.
